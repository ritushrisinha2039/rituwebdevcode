    <title>My drawing experience</title>
</head>
<body>
 My name is Ritushri Sinha. Now i want to talk about my drawing experience in my life. So i started my drawing when i was in class 3.
 I was soo much interested and passionate about this that's why i put enough efforts and concentration to learn the whole thing.
 Firstly i started from basic pastel colours and then i keep practicing . After learning the pastel i went through water colour which was very amazing.
 Water colour was a little bit messy but it was very beautiful after all the shades and finishing touch. it took few months to grow my depth in water colour.
 But finally i learnt the water colour part vert properly. Then i gave my second year drawing exam and secured a good score which made me very happy nd increased my confidence level to learn more.
 After water colour i started the pencil sketch part which was very difficult for everyone but after practicing constantly i got attracted toward this and keep learning more deeply.
 Also in my 3rd year drawing exam i got a very good marks and a certificate. I have learnt many more things in that drawing school as example glass painting, 3D painting, wall painting etc.
 it was my grade 10 when i stopped going to drawing school because of my study pressure. i always wanted to continue my drawing career any how but i was forced to stop this from my family so unfortunately i ended my drawing career there.
 But it was a great journey for me to learn every corner of drawing very properly. I am very grateful to my drawing teacher who taught me the whole thing and help me out for developing my skill.
 It was all about my drwing experience. Thank you.
